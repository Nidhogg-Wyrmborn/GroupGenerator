# Group Generator

This is a project that I made for school, the main purpose is to take a list of names or IDs and sort them into groups of a certain number (supplied by user)

# usage

double click the exe (latest version under the dist folder)
It will check for an update, and if one is available download it and restart.

once it loads, it will ask if you want to create a new list
If you click yes, then it will ask you what to save it as, then create the file and store instructions on how to make the list

If you click no, then it will ask you where the list is, then open it and extract data

after having loaded the data, it will ask for the number of students/people per group

after entering X number it will sort the students into groups of X number
